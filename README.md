# Airline Reservation Management System

The goal of this project on Airline Management System is to automate the airline registration procedure. The system includes information such as passenger information, flight information, and a list of all passengers, as well as the ability to store and retrieve data linked to the airline business and conduct air travel transactions.The system is able to provide much information like passengerâ€™s details, flight details and the booking details.

When a passenger reserves a ticket, the technology also allows us to add records. MySQL Database is used to store and retrieve data. It allows us to add as many records as we want to our database.
